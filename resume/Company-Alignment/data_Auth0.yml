allignment:
- lp: Collaboration
  position: Collaboration
  company: 3 Startups, Teaching, & Technobunnies 
  description: Teaching is a collaborative arena where trust must be built with a wide range of stakeholders that own little domain knowledge. Good listening and empathy are key skills that I bring to trust-building. As a freelancer, my customer (i.e. client) management skills have expanded even further with dynamics that involve my being the most technically competent member of the team guiding my client, to my being the least technically-competent member of my team peddling hard to keep up with my client. In all instances, I maintain honesty, including asking all my daft questions. As a technical writer, that often means extracting highly technical information from Product Managers, Developers, and Scrum Masters until I can digest and rework that data independently. 

- lp: Mentor
  position: Mentorship
  company: Freefund, Teaching, & Technobunnies
  description: As Data Manager at Freefund, I selected members of the data input team and trained them for customer service support. As Technobunnies, I often recruit and manage freelancers for projects. This includes identifying individuals with potential locally who have never freelanced and assisting them to transition to the mindset required to succeed, including providing the "backbone" to adopt a learn and earn philosophy. I am the organizer of a local Meetup group with 500+ members for whom I mentor individuals interested in transitioning to remote freelance work.

- lp: Right Alot & Learn and Be Curious 
  position: Build Participation
  company: Freefund & Teaching
  description: As a Head of Department at 2 schools and assistant head at 1, I have spent years building participation and support for systems that allow the team to work smarter not harder, that require an initial time investment. As a teacher, I also organized outreach to economically challenged schools.

- lp: Hire & Develop the best & Insist on Highest Standards
  position: Technical Writing
  company: Technobunnies 
  description: To write concise and accessible documentation, I apply principles such as atomization and single sourcing, for example, using _includes for markdown in Jekyll for RestHeart. With most clients, my work undergoes a review cycle, or I am brought in to review another writer's product. For example, with Braze I verified alignment with a new style guide. A big part of my success as a Technical Writer, with over 70 projects completed, is my ability to land neck-deep in someone's software or service and understand that at speed. I have built me self-confidence to the point that I know if I can understand something, then I can assist others to comprehend it also.

- lp: Think Big
  position: Contribute to Initiatives
  company: Technobunnies 
  description: I maintain a big picture perspective, while sweating the small stuff, for example, reworking the RestHeart documentation and website. There is a wealth of information that I am making far more accessible as a result of restructuring and reorganizing. I am enjoying the collaborative process required to achieve this end.

- lp: Think Big
  position: Requirements not covered above
  description: Proven ability to build a culture of documentation within a company â€“ e.g. Rappi, Head of Department (information management and sharing). Proven understanding of modern software development concepts, e.g. case studies with Tangent, Reustle LLC, and architectural overview materials for Distributed Devs and serverless technology articles for oneclick and Lumigo. Self-driven, with strong time management and prioritization skills, for example, 5+ years freelancing remotely, 10 years as a teacher meeting ongoing cycles of hard deadlines.
