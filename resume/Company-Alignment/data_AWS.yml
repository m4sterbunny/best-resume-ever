  position: Head of Department
  timeperiod: 2005â€“2015

- company: Freefund.com
  position: Data Manager
  timeperiod: 1999â€“2000
  description: 2nd person in the London office of a Swedish startup.

Onboarded with a SQL database not performing as per spec; quickly developed an equivalent in MS Access, allowing work to continue. 

allignment:
- lp: Customer Obsession
  position: Customer Obsession 
  company: Freefund, High School Teacher, and Technobunnies 
  timeperiod: 17 years
  description: At Freefund I was in charge of customer services and implemented a data-driven approch to customer issue-tracking. Teaching is also a customer-obsessed arena where trust must be built with stakeholders that own little domain knowledge. Good listening and empathy are key skills that I bring to trust-building. As a freelancer, my customer (i.e. client) management skills have expanded even further with dynamics that involve my being the most technically competent member of the team guiding my client, to my being the least technically-competent member of my team peddling hard to keep up with my client. In all instances I maintain honesty, even though that means asking all my daft questions.

- lp: Ownership
  position: Ownership, Simplify, Good Instincts
  company: Freefund
  timeperiod: 2 years
  description: Due to SQL server's instability, the Swedish Data Manager could not pass me an empty database to populate as planned. I created an Access equivalent with hacks to manage the multiple connection issues. With rollout still... rolling, I was sent with my solution to the Berlin startup, where I trained and supported the team. This relieved the Swedish Data Manager to fix the SQL server issues. I worked the patch room and acted as IT support in the London office. A typical "own what needs to be done" startup philosophy that I have never put down.

- lp: Right Alot & Learn and Be Curious 
  position: Learning and Curiosity
  company: Technobunnies + Further Education 
  timeperiod: 5 years + >Decade
  description: My freelancing career has reinforced a learn and earn philosophy. When I left teaching 5+ years ago, I was competent in the Microsoft suite. Now I work in IDEs, SDKs, and the command line and contribute to clients' repos. I can build static sites; set up and connect cloud VMs, storage, and functions; and massage HTML and CSS. Multiple clients, knowing that I have poor domain knowledge have engaged me to work out how to achieve an outcome, rather than appoint someone else. For example, the indexing of Parasitic Diseases, and reverting data-handling errors for The Tree App.

- lp: Hire & Develop the best & Insist on Highest Standards
  position: Develop the Best and Insist on High Standards
  company: Technobunnies + Teaching
  timeperiod: 5 years + Decade
  description: Common to both teaching and partnering for work, is the discovery that not everyone is a finisher and that a person's initial vision may crumble (I once included myself in the shaper, not finisher class). For more than 15 years, I have applied my standards to be the bar that I ask other people to reach. I believe I do that with humour, honesty, and by example.

- lp: Think Big
  position: Think Big, Bias for Action, Frugality, Have Backbone
  company: Freelancing 
  timeperiod: 5 years
  description: I didn't start my agency with money, I emerged from a decade of criminally low pay as a teacher. I manage budgets and deadlines well, for example, recruiting and managing a team for a British Council tender. I apply momentum to a project's pace, have a good nose for identifying blockers and good instincts for when to switch mode from perfectionism to a utilitarian approach, for example, accepting a duplication of references rate in Parasitic Diseases.
